# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game. Initially, it was played entirely in the console. Now, it is played on the webpage. The player plays Rock Paper Scissors with the computer until either the player or the computer wins by reaching five points. The player clicks buttons to choose either rock, paper, or scissors. The results, such as the running scores, are displayed on the webpage.

I used HTML to create the basic website. I mainly used JavaScript to create the Rock Paper Scissors game. Initially, I created a function to play five rounds of Rock Paper Scissors. Now, I added a UI. I worked with the DOM to add an event listener to the buttons and display the results on the webpage.
