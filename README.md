# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that is played entirely in the console. The player plays five rounds of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. Scores are kept track of. The winner is then determined.

I used HTML to create the basic website. I mainly used JavaScript to create the Rock Paper Scissors game. I created functions to get the choices of rock, paper, or scissors. I also created functions to play either a single round or multiple rounds of Rock Paper Scissors.
